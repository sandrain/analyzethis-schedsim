= Single Host Simulation =

The simulator can be used to simulate a single host with n AFEs and N cores. To activate
this mode, simply do *not* specify any hosts ('-N' argument). For instance,

./sim.py -c 2 -n 4 workflows/montage_60.xml

simulates a single host with 2 cores and 4 AFEs.

This simulation mode relies on the scheduler from the libanalysis library. To enable it,
you must specify where the library is installed using the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

export PYTHONPATH=/where/libanalyzethis/is/src:$PYTHONPATH

= Multi-host Simulation =

The simulator can be used to simulate a distributed platform. In this context, the simulated
distributed platform can include several servers (nodes hosting the AFEs) and several
clients. This mode requires the libanalyzethis library and it is required to specify where
the library is installed using the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

export PYTHONPATH=/where/libanalyzethis/is/src:$PYTHONPATH

To activate the multi-host mode, simply specify the number of nodes on the command line:

./sim.py -N 2 -c 2 -n 2 workflows/montage_60.xml

which simulates 2 server nodes, each node having 2 cores and 2 AFEs.
